# Next.js 15 Error: Invalid JSX Expression with dangerouslySetInnerHTML

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered in Next.js 15 when using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` within a functional component.  The error arises because the approach used is not a valid JSX expression in the context of Next.js 15's stricter rendering rules.  This issue specifically highlights that rendering untrusted HTML should be handled with caution, emphasizing secure practices.

## Problem

The provided `about.js` attempts to render HTML using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.  While functional in older versions of Next.js, this approach is problematic in version 15.  The component throws an error as it's not a valid JSX expression.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates a safer and more compliant way to achieve the same result.  Instead of relying on `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, it directly utilizes JSX for rendering the HTML content. This approach is cleaner and avoids potential security vulnerabilities that could arise from using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without proper sanitization.
